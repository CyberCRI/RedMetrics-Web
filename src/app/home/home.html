<h1>Welcome to RedMetrics</h1>

<p>RedMetrics offers open source game analytics. It is made up of a <a href="https://github.com/CyberCRI/RedMetrics">RESTful web service</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/CyberCRI/RedMetrics-client">web app</a> that allows game designers, researchers, and teachers to track game metrics, then download the raw data for offline analysis.</p>

<p>Like existing services, RedMetrics allows you to track player progression through your game. But RedMetrics goes a step further by also tracking <i>snapshots</i> - a recording of gameplay that can include game state such as entities, player input, and anything else that a designers wish to track.</p>

<p>In the spirit of open data, all data gathered on RedMetrics is freely available, with players only identified by anonymous identifiers. Data can be viewed via the website or downloaded for statistical analysis. </p>

<p>RedMetrics has been designed to integrate nicely with <a href="http://redwire.io">RedWire</a>, an open source game engine for remixing and mashups. But as a web service, any internet-connected game can use it.</p>

<p>To use RedMetrics for your game, check out the <a href="https://github.com/CyberCRI/RedMetrics/API.md">web api</a>. You can use the hosted version at <a href="redmetrics.io">redmetrics.io</a> or <a href="https://github.com/CyberCRI/RedMetrics">download the software</a> and run your own instance.</p>
